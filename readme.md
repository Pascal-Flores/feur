## What does "Feur" mean ?

Feur is a french "word" (it is not technically a word) that is supposed to be said after someone says "Quoi ?" (which means "What ?" in french). It is used for humoristic (or not) purposes, because the juxtaposition of the two words makes "coiffeur" (which means "hairdresser" in french). Other examples of this kind of puns are "Qui ? Quette" or "Comment ? Dant de bord".
I chose this name because I love to say "Feur" to everybody because it's very annoying :)
